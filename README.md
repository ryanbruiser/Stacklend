How It Works

1. **Lenders Deposit:** Users deposit STX or tokens into the StackLend pool.  
2. **Borrowers Request Loans:** Borrowers lock collateral and borrow a percentage of its value.  
3. **Interest Accrues:** Borrowers repay loans with added interest that goes to lenders.  
4. **Liquidation:** If collateral value drops below a safe threshold, loans are auto-liquidated.  

This ensures fairness and sustainability for both lenders and borrowers.
